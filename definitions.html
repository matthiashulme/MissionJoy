            <h4>Depression</h4>
            <p class="box">
              Depression is a common mental health disorder characterized by
              persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest or
              pleasure in daily activities. It goes beyond the usual ups and downs
              that people experience in life. Individuals with depression may also
              experience changes in appetite, sleep patterns, and energy levels. Other
              common symptoms include difficulty concentrating, feelings of
              worthlessness or guilt, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide.

            <h4>Anxiety</h4>
            <p class="box">
              Anxiety is a common mental health condition marked by excessive worry,
              fear, and heightened stress. It can manifest as physical symptoms like
              restlessness, muscle tension, and difficulty concentrating. Anxiety can
              range from mild to severe, and individuals may experience specific
              phobias, panic attacks, or generalized anxiety disorder. It can
              interfere with daily life and functioning. Treatment often involves
              therapy, medication, or a combination of both, and lifestyle changes may
              also be beneficial. If persistent, seeking professional help is
              recommended.

            <h4>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</h4>
            <p class="box">
              PTSD is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or
              witnessing a traumatic event. Symptoms include intrusive memories,
              nightmares, flashbacks, and intense emotional distress. Individuals with
              PTSD may avoid reminders of the trauma, experience heightened arousal
              (such as being easily startled), and may have negative changes in mood
              and cognition. PTSD can significantly impact daily life and
              relationships. Treatment often involves therapy, particularly approaches
              like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and sometimes medication.
              Seeking professional help is crucial for effective management of PTSD.

            <h4>Schizophrenia</h4>
            <p class="box">
              Schizophrenia is a severe mental health disorder characterized by
              disruptions in thought processes, emotions, and perception of reality.
              Common symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized
              thinking, and impaired social or occupational functioning. Individuals
              with schizophrenia may experience changes in behavior, reduced emotional
              expression, and difficulties with memory and concentration. Treatment
              typically involves antipsychotic medications and psychosocial
              interventions. It is a chronic condition that requires ongoing
              management and support. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for
              better outcomes in individuals with schizophrenia.
