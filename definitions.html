      <h4>Depression</h4>
      <p>
        Depression is a common mental health disorder characterized by
        persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest or
        pleasure in daily activities. It goes beyond the usual ups and downs
        that people experience in life. Individuals with depression may also
        experience changes in appetite, sleep patterns, and energy levels. Other
        common symptoms include difficulty concentrating, feelings of
        worthlessness or guilt, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide.
      </p>

      <h4>Anxiety</h4>
      <p>
        Anxiety is a common mental health condition marked by excessive worry,
        fear, and heightened stress. It can manifest as physical symptoms like
        restlessness, muscle tension, and difficulty concentrating. Anxiety can
        range from mild to severe, and individuals may experience specific
        phobias, panic attacks, or generalized anxiety disorder. It can
        interfere with daily life and functioning. Treatment often involves
        therapy, medication, or a combination of both, and lifestyle changes may
        also be beneficial. If persistent, seeking professional help is
        recommended.
      </p>

      <h4>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</h4>
      <p>
        PTSD is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or
        witnessing a traumatic event. Symptoms include intrusive memories,
        nightmares, flashbacks, and intense emotional distress. Individuals with
        PTSD may avoid reminders of the trauma, experience heightened arousal
        (such as being easily startled), and may have negative changes in mood
        and cognition. PTSD can significantly impact daily life and
        relationships. Treatment often involves therapy, particularly approaches
        like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and sometimes medication.
        Seeking professional help is crucial for effective management of PTSD.
      </p>

      <h4>Schizophrenia</h4>
      <p>
        Schizophrenia is a severe mental health disorder characterized by
        disruptions in thought processes, emotions, and perception of reality.
        Common symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized
        thinking, and impaired social or occupational functioning. Individuals
        with schizophrenia may experience changes in behavior, reduced emotional
        expression, and difficulties with memory and concentration. Treatment
        typically involves antipsychotic medications and psychosocial
        interventions. It is a chronic condition that requires ongoing
        management and support. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for
        better outcomes in individuals with schizophrenia.
      </p>

      <!-- <h4>Diarrhea</h4>
      <p>
        Diarrhea is a common digestive system disorder characterized by the
        frequent passage of loose or watery stools. It can be caused by various
        factors, including infections, viruses, bacteria, certain medications,
        and dietary issues. Diarrhea may also be a symptom of an underlying
        medical condition. Dehydration is a concern with prolonged or severe
        diarrhea, so it's important to stay hydrated by drinking fluids. In most
        cases, diarrhea is a temporary issue, but persistent or severe cases may
        require medical attention.
